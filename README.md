# Welcome to Matthew Wester's Portfolio with Responsive Elements

## This is a responsive portfolio using bootstrap elements.

The deployed website may be found at: (https://ayeser.github.io/second_assignment_responsive_portfolio/)

The website has three pages:

1. About Me
2. Contact
3. Portfolio

This website includes dynamic elements, for example:

This is what the About Me page looks like in a wide browser:
